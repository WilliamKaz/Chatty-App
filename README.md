This project is a completed fork of a boiler plate template of a basic slack clone site. 

This webpage acts as an instant message thread that allows users to post to a continuous timeline of chat messages and set unique usernames. No login is required users go from Anonymous to their set names and the name changes are logged in the timeline as well. The system keeps track of how many users are connected to the baord regardless if these users have posted yet



### Static Files

You can store static files like images, fonts, etc in the `build` folder.

For example, if you copy a file called my_image.png into the build folder you can access it using `http://localhost:3000/build/my_image.png`.
